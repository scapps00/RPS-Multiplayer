# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Multiplayer Game

My first Firebase project. Play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock with a stranger or a friend. Includes a chat feature.

## Getting Started

This project is built to run with a Firebase database. Either play the game with my Firebase database at www.samanthacapps.com/rpsls or see below for how to set up your own Firebase database.

### Prerequisites

If you are using your own database, get a Firebase account at firebase.google.com

### Installing

The template for the Firebae database is as follows:

```
{
  "move1" : {
    "move1" : "0"
  },
  "move2" : {
    "move2" : "0"
  },
  "playerInfo" : {
    "name1" : "",
    "name2" : "",
    "numPlayers" : "0",
    "score1" : 0,
    "score2" : 0
  },
  "status1" : {
    "message1" : ""
  },
  "status2" : {
    "message2" : ""
  },
  "visible1" : {
    "visible1" : ""
  },
  "visible2" : {
    "visible2" : ""
  }
}
```

Replace my Firebase connection info with your own in each JavaScript file.

## Deployment

I hid my API key for deployment using Config Variables in Heroku. Use whatever method works for you.
